# Rule of 72

The Rule of 72 is a simple way to determine how long an investment will take to double given a fixed annual rate of interest. By dividing 72 by the annual rate of return, investors obtain a rough estimate of how many years it will take for the initial investment to duplicate itself.

Shortcut to `approximate` effect of compound interest.

```
72/Return-Rate = Number of years to double
72/12 = 6
```

## Derivation

R - rate of return
N - Number of years

```
1 * (1+R)^N = 2
(1+R)^N = 2
ln( (1+R)^N ) = ln(2) [natural log of both sides]
N * ln(1+R) = .693
N * R = .693 [For small R, ln(1+R) ~ R]
N = .693 / R
```
