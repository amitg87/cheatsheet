## Foreward

(Conventional wisodom)Parents say - "Study hard and get good grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits". There goal in life is to provide a college education for kids, os that they have greatest chance of success in life.

Look around; the richest people didn't get rich because of their educations. Look at Michael Jordan and Madonna. Even Bill Gates, who dropped out of Harvard, founded Microsoft; he is now the richest man in America, and he's still in his 30s.

The World has changed but the advice hasn't. Job requires working harder and harder only to pay more taxes and wind up in debt. There is no job security anymore; it's all about downsizing and rightsizing. Many of today's youth have credit cards before they leave high school, yet they have never had a course in money or how to invest it, let alone understand how compound interest works on credit cards. Simply put, without financial literacy and the knowledge of how money works, they are not prepared to face the world that awaits them, a world in which spending is emphasized over savings.

**Implications of downsizing**
the difference between an employee and employer, but also the difference between controlling your own destiny and giving up that control to someone else.
_People get laid off in publicly listed company_
    Individual - Families are hurt. Unemployment goes up.
    Companies - The price of the stock usually goes up, The market likes it when a company reduces its labor costs

_Different set of rules - Employees lose; owners and investors win._

It is foolish to assume that the education the school system provides will prepare your children for the world they will face upon graduation. Each child needs more education. Different education. And they need to know the rules. The different sets of rules.

What follows is the story of Robert's two dads, a rich one and a poor one, that expounds on the skills he's developed over a lifetime. The contrast between two dads provides an important perspective.

## Chapter 1: Rich dad, Poor Dad

I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly educated and intelligent. The other father never finished the eighth grade.

Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one struggled financially all his life. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities and his church. The other left bills to be paid.

Both men were strong, charismatic and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did not advise the same things. Both men believed strongly in education but did not recommend the same course of study.

If I had had only one dad, I would have had to accept or reject his advice. Having two dads advising me offered me the choice of contrasting points of view; one of a rich man and one of a poor man.

Instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other, I found myself thinking more, comparing and then choosing for myself.
They had very different points of view about the subject of money.

```
Poor dad - "Love for money is root of all evil"
Rich dad - "The lack of money is root of all evil"
```

Money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skills, but not on financial skills. Most of us learn about money from our parents.

Difference in Thinking Over a costly item
```
Poor Data - “I can't afford it.”
Rich Dad - “How can I afford it?"
```

By asking “How can I afford it?", your brain is put to work. Proper physical exercise increases your chances for health, and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth. Laziness decreases both health and wealth.

**Taxes**

```
Poor dad thought that the rich should pay more in taxes to take care of those less fortunate.
Rich dad - "Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't produce."
```

**Education**

Poor dad - "Study hard so you can find a good company to work for."
Rich dad - "Study hard so you can find a good company to buy."

**Risk**
Poor dad - "When it comes to money, play it safe, don't take risks."
Rich Dad - "Learn to manage risk."

**Retirement**
Poor dad - "I've worked hard for the government, and I'm entitled to these benefits.”
Rich dad - believed in total financial self-reliance. He spoke out against the "entitlement" mentality and how it was creating weak and financially needy people. He was emphatic about being financially competent.

I noticed that my poor dad was poor not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant, but because of his thoughts and actions.

Although both men had tremendous respect for education and learning, they disagreed in what they thought was important to learn. One wanted me to study hard, earn a degree and get a good job to work for money. The other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how money works and to learn how to have it work for me. "I don't work for money!" were words he would repeat over and over, "Money works for me!”

Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.

## Lesson #1 The Rich Don't Work for Money

What did I learn?

Life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, `Wake up. There's something I want you to learn.`

If you learn life's lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around.

If you learn this lesson, you will grow into a wise, wealthy and happy young man. If you don't, you will spend your life blaming a job, low pay or your boss for your problems. You'll live life hoping for that big break that will solve all your money problems.

You'd best change your point of view. Stop blaming the boss or job, thinking it's the problem. If you think I'm the problem, then you have to change me. If you realize that you're the problem, then you can change yourself, learn something and grow wiser. Most people want everyone else in the world to change but themselves. It's easier to change yourself than everyone else.

What most people do. They quit and go looking for another job, better opportunity, and higher pay, actually thinking that a new job or more pay will solve the problem. In most cases, it won't.

If better paycheck won't solve then what will?
So what will solve the problem? The stuff between your ears.

The poor and the middle class work for money.
The rich have money work for them.

You see, true learning takes energy, passion, a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them: Fear does.”

Just know that it's fear that keeps most people working at a job. The fear of not paying their bills. The fear of being fired. The fear of not having enough money. The fear of having to starting over. That's the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money... and then get angry at their boss.

You're taxed when you earn. You're taxed when you spend. You're taxed when you save. You're taxed when you die.

Most people never study the subject. They go to work, get their paycheck, balance their checkbooks, and that's it. On top of that, they wonder why they have money problems. Then, they think that more money will solve the problem.

Few realize that it's their lack of financial education that is the problem.

Human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.

It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that.

A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Most people have only one problem in mind, and it's short term. It's the bills at the end of the month. Money now runs their lives. Or should I say the fear and ignorance about money.

“The sooner you forget about needing a paycheck, the easier your adult life will be. Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see things that other people never see.

Started Business - Library of comics

By not getting paid for our work at the store, we were forced to use our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money. By starting our own business, the comic-book library, we were in control of our own finances, not dependent on an employer. The best part was that our business generated money for us, even when we weren't physically there. Our money worked for us. Instead of paying us money, rich dad had given us so much more.

## Lesson 2# Why Teach Financial Literacy?

Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone.

Most people fail to realize that in life, it's not how much money you make, it's how much money you keep. We have all heard stories of lottery winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, then poor again. They win millions and are soon back to where they started. Or stories of professional athletes, who, at the age of 24, are earning millions of dollars a year, and are sleeping under a bridge by age 34.
It's not how much you make, it's how much you keep, and how many generations you keep it.

Accounting - most important subject - if you want to be rich, long term, it could be the most important subject.

Question is how do you teach boring subject? Simple ways to teach: pictures and words. simple drawing

### Rule One. You must know the difference between an asset and a liability, and buy assets.

Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities, but they think they are assets.
If you want to be rich, this is all you need to know. Most people struggle financially because they do not know the difference between an asset and a liability.

Cash Flow pattern of an asset

|Income|Expenses|
|--|--|

|Asset|Liabilities|
|--|--|


The above box is an Income Statement, often called a Profit and Loss Statement. It measures income and expenses. Money in and money out. The bottom diagram is the Balance Sheet. It is called that because it is supposed to balance assets against liabilities. Many financial novices don't know the relationship between the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet.

That relationship is vital to understand. The primary cause of financial struggle is simply not knowing the difference between an asset and a liability.

**An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket.**

This is really all you need to know. If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities. It's not knowing the difference that causes most of the financial struggle in the real world.

Cash flow pattern of a poor person, or a young person still at home:

Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Rent Clothes Fun Transportation)
Asset (none)
Liability (none)

Cash flow pattern of a person in the middle class:

Job (provides income)-> Expenses(Taxes Food Mortgage Clothes Fun Transportation)
Asset (none)
Liability (Mortgage Consumer loans Credit Cards)

Cash flow pattern of a wealthy person:

Assets(stocks bonds notes real estate intellectual property)->income (dividends interest rental income royalties)
Liabilities (none)

All of these diagrams were obviously oversimplified. Everyone has living expenses, the need for food, shelter and clothing.
The diagrams show the flow of cash through a poor, middle class or wealthy person's life. It is the story of how a person handles their money, what they do after they get the money in their hand.

More money seldom solves someone's money problems.
If you find you have dug yourself into a hole... stop digging.

As a child, my dad often told us that the Japanese were aware of three powers; `The power of the sword, the jewel and the mirror.`

1. The sword symbolizes the power of weapons.
2. The jewel symbolizes the power of money. Remember the golden rule - He who has the gold makes the rules.
3. The mirror symbolizes the power of self-knowledge. Most treasured of the three.

One dad thought his house was an asset, and the other dad thought it was a liability. I remember when I drew a diagram for my dad showing him the direction of cash flow.

I really do not expect most people to agree with it because a nice home is an emotional thing. And when it comes to 1 know from personal money, high emotions tend to lower financial intelligence.

1. Pay for house owned by by bank.
2. taxes + maintenance
3. houses do not always go up in value
4. The greatest losses of all are those from missed opportunities.

Your money is tied up in your house, you may be forced to work harder because your money continues blowing out of the expense column, instead of adding to the asset column, the classic middle class cash flow pattern. If a young couple would put more money into their asset column early on, their later years would get easier. Their assets would have grown and would be available to help cover expenses.

I am not saying don't buy a house. I am saying, understand the difference between an asset and a liability. When I want a bigger house, I first buy assets that will generate the cash flow to pay for the house.

Educated dads expenses seem to always keep up with his income, never allowing him to invest in assets. As a result, his liabilities, such as his mortgage and credit card debts are larger than his assets.

**Educated Dad's Financial Statement**

```
Income=Expense
Asset < Liability
```

Income goes up, Expenses go up. Assets do not increase, Liabilities do increase.

**Rich Dad's Financial Statement**

```
Income > Expense
Asset > Liability
```

The asset column generates more than enough income to cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the asset column. The asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces grows with it.

The result being: The rich get richer!

Income -> Assets -> More Income
Expenses are low, Liabilities are low.

Learnings to get started on a path to becoming rich.

1. The most important rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability.
2. Once you understand the difference - difference, concentrate your efforts on only buying income-generating assets.
3. Keep doing that and your asset column will grow. Focus on keeping liabilities and expenses down.
4. This will make more money available to continue pouring into the asset column.

If you do what the masses do, you get the following picture.

Income = Work for Owner
Expense = Work for Government
Asset = (none)
Liability = Work for Bank

As an employee who is also a homeowner, your working efforts are generally as follows:

1. You work for someone else. Most people, working for a paycheck, are making the owner, or the shareholders richer. Your efforts and success will help provide for the owner's success and retirement.
2. You work for the government. The government takes its share from your paycheck before you even see it. just for the government.
3. You work for the bank. After taxes, your next largest expense is usually your mortgage and credit card debt.

The problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share of your increased efforts. By working harder, you simply increase the amount of taxes taken by the government.

### Wealth

Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days forward... or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive(goal to become financially independent)?

Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column compared with the expense column.
When I have achieved a month cash flow from my assets, then I will be wealthy.

So I am not yet rich, but I am wealthy. I now have income generated from assets each month that fully cover my monthly expenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my cash flow from assets to maintain this level of wealth.

Take notice that it is at this point that I no longer am dependent on my wages. I have focused on and been successful in building an asset column that has made me financially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to cover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets.

My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the asset column.
The more money that goes into my asset column, the more my asset column grows. The more my assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my expenses less than the cash flow from these assets, I will grow richer, with more and more income from sources other than my physical labor.

As this reinvestment process continues, I am well on my way to being rich.
The actual definition of rich is in the eye of the beholder. You can never be too rich.

Just remember this simple observation: The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets.

## Lesson 3# Mind Your Own Business

Financial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their life for someone else. Many people will have nothing at the end of their working days.

Most people: Your Profession -> Your Income
The Rich:  Your Assets -> Your Income

To become financially secure, a person needs to mind their own business. Your business revolves around your asset column, as opposed to your income column. As stated earlier, the No. 1 rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability, and to buy assets. The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.

Income column and will only help a person become more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income-generating assets.

Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home. A new car loses nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot. It is not a true asset even if your banker lets you list it as one.

In my world, real assets fall into several different categories:

1. Businesses that do not require my presence. I own them, but they are managed or run by other people.
2. Stocks.
3. Bonds.
4. Mutual funds.
5. Income-generating real estate.
6. Notes (lOUs).
7. Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, patents.
8. And anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates and has a ready market.

My rich dad, on the other hand, encouraged me to begin acquiring assets that I loved.

Keep your daytime job and mind your own business. When I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way, once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations.

Keep your daytime job, be a great hard-working employee, but keep building that asset column.

As your cash flow grows, you can buy some luxuries. An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the middle class often buy luxury items such as big houses, diamonds, furs, jewelry or boats because they want to look rich. They look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The old-money people, the long-term rich, built their asset column first. Then, the income generated from the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood and children's inheritance.

## Lesson 4# The History of and The Power of Corporation

Income tax is modern tax - was introduced only a centure ago. Idea was to take from rich and give to poor. As requirement for money grew due to in-efficient usage taxes trickeled to middle class.

Rich people paid smart people to figure out how to avoid tax - Corporation. Income tax rate on corporation is lower than individual income tax.

The Rich People With Corporations

1. Earn
2. Spend
3. Pay Taxes

The People Who Work for Corporations

1. Earn
2. Pay Taxes
3. Spend

Rich people account for expenses in pre-tax dollars through corporation.

Financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise.

1. Accounting
The more money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required, or the house comes tumbling down. Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business. Ability to read and understand financial stements.
2. Investing
What I call the science of money making money. This involves strategies and formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative side.
3. Understanding Markets
The science of supply and demand. There is a need to know the "technical" aspects of the market, which is emotion driven. The other market factor is the "fundamental" or the economic sense of an investment. Does an investment make sense or does it not make sense based on the current market conditions.
4. Law
Utilizing a corporation wrapped around the technical skills of accounting, investing and markets can aid explosive growth. An individual with the knowledge of the tax advantages and protection provided by a corporation can get rich so much faster than someone who is an employee or a small-business sole proprietor. It's like the difference between someone walking and someone flying.
   1. Tax advantages
   A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for expenses before it pays taxes.
   It's one of the biggest legal tax loopholes that the rich use. For example; by owning your own corporation - vacations are board meetings in Hawaii. Car payments, insurance, repairs are company expenses. Health club membership is a company expense. Most restaurant meals are partial expenses. And on and on - but do it legally with pre-tax dollars.

   2. Protection from lawsuits
   We live in a litigious society. Everybody wants a piece of your action. The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles such as corporations and trusts to protect their assets from creditors. When someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met with layers of legal protection, and often find that the wealthy person actually owns nothing. They control everything, but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to the government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich.

## Lesson 5# The Rich Invent Money

Land was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the land owned the wealth. Then, it was factories and production, and America rose to dominance. The industrialist owned the wealth. Today, it is information. And the person who has the most timely information owns the wealth. The problem is, information flies all around the world at the speed of light. The new wealth cannot be contained by boundaries and borders as land and factories were. The changes will be faster and more dramatic. There will be a dramatic increase in the number of new multimillionaires. There also will be those who are left behind.

Today, I find so many people struggling, often working harder, simply because they cling to old ideas. They want things to be the way they were; they resist change. I know people who are losing their jobs or their houses, and they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly they fail to realize that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their biggest liability. It is a liability simply because they fail to realize that while that idea or way of doing something was an asset yesterday, yesterday is gone.

Getting out of rat race - People who take the longest are people who are not familiar with numbers and often do not understand the power of investing. Rich people are often creative and take calculated risks.

## Lesson 6# Work to Learn - Don't Work for Money

Great talent is not enough. Need to sold correctly.

Rich dad encouraged me to know a little about a lot. That is why for years I worked in different areas of his companies. Important to pick up "jargon" and a sense of what is important and what is not.
Rich dad insisted we sit in on the meetings with his bankers, lawyers, accountants and brokers. He wanted us to know a little about every aspect of his empire.

I was studying trade, people, business styles and cultures
Leadership is what you need to learn next. If you're not a good leader, you'll get shot in the back, just like they do in business.

Most workers focus on working for pay and benefits that reward them in the short term, but is often disastrous in the long.
Instead I recommend to young people to seek work for what they will learn, more than what they will earn. Look down the road at what ; skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before getting trapped in the "Rat Race."

Education is more valuable than money, in the long run.

The world is filled with talented poor people. All too often, they're 
poor or struggle financially or earn less than they are capable of, not  because of what they know but because of what they do not know. They focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger. Maybe McDonald's does not make the best hamburger, but they are the best at  selling and delivering a basic average burger.

Where is this daily activity taking you? What does the future hold? Grab what don't have.

The main management skills needed for success are:

1. The management of cash flow
2. The management of systems (including yourself and time with family)
3. The management of people.

The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding marketing. It is communication skills such as writing, speaking and negotiating that are crucial to a life of success.

## Lesson - Overcoming obstactle

Once people have studied and become financially literate, they may still face roadblocks to becoming financially independent. There are five main reasons why financially literate people may still not develop abundant asset columns.
The five reasons are:

1. Fear
    The fear of losing money is real. Everyone has it. Even the rich. But it's not fear that is the problem. It's how you handle fear. It's how you handle losing. It's how you handle failure that makes the difference in one's life.

2. Cynicism
    Overcoming cynicism

    What if the economy crashes right after I invest? What if I lose control and I can't pay the money back? What if things don't go as I planned? If it's such a good idea, how come someone else hasn't done it?
    Most people are poor because when it comes to investing, the world is filled with Chicken Littles running around yelling, "The sky is falling. The sky is falling."
    Cynics never win. Unchecked doubt and fear creates a cynic. Cynics criticize, and winners analyze.

3. Laziness
    Busy people are often the most lazy.
    Most common form of laziness - Laziness by staying busy.
    Today, I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their wealth/health. The cause is the same. They're busy, and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something they do not want to face. Nobody has to tell them. Deep down they know. In fact, if you remind them, they often respond with anger or irritation.

    So what is the cure for laziness? The answer is a little greed - What's In It-For Me? What's in it for me if I'm healthy, sexy and good looking? What would my life be like if I never had to work again? What would I do if I had all the money I needed?

    Without that little greed, the desire to have something better, progress is not made. Our world progresses because we all desire a better life. New inventions are made because we desire something better.
    `Greed is good. Guilt is worse than greed.`

4. Bad habits

    Our lives are a reflection of our habits more than our education.
    Habits control behavior.
    Habits of the rich - learn through example, as usual.

5. Arrogance

    Arrogance is ego plus ignorance.
    Every time I have been arrogant, I have lost money.
    People use arrogance to try to hide their own ignorance.
    When you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by finding an expert in the field or find a book on the subject.
